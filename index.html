                        <!-- about you -->
                        <p>I was born and raised in Costa Rica, when I was a senior in High School I moved to the United States for a better future. I joined the US Army  years later as a way to give a little bit back to the country that has given me a lot of what I am and what I have. With the GI Bill I was able to go to school and graduate with a business administration degree. For the last year of so I have discovered that one for my tru passions is working with coding and software, I really hope I can make it into your program to be able to find a better work opportunity but also to be able to do something I enjoy everyday.</p>
